# Common Stateful Skill CLI Protocol 1.0

This runtime gives executable skills one provider-neutral interface. Stateful
skills use `doctor`, `start`, `status`, `next`, and lifecycle-specific
`validate` or `finalize` transitions. Stateless skills use `doctor` and `run`.
It uses only the Python standard library and invokes existing skill scripts
without a shell.

## Invocation

```text
python /absolute/runtime/tools/skill_cli.py \
  --skill-dir /absolute/installed/skill \
  --repo-root /absolute/target/repository \
  [--run-dir /absolute/external/run] \
  [--input name=value ...] \
  --format <human|json> \
  <doctor|run|start|status|next|validate|finalize>
```

An installed skill may expose `scripts/cli.py`, which fixes `--skill-dir` to
that package and passes its own path to the runtime. Responses from such an
adapter keep returning that local CLI in `next_command.argv`. Core skills
carry a synchronized standard-library fallback so this remains operable when
the repository-level `tools/` directory is absent.

`doctor` does not require a run directory. `start` requires a new run
directory. Every later stateful command requires the directory created by
`start`. A skill may require the run directory to be outside the target
repository. Every skill requires it to be outside the installed skill.

A stateful manifest may declare a deterministic `classification` phase.
For those skills, `start` writes and returns the classification through
`result` without running the existing setup command. The first `next` binds the
recommended typed inputs and runs that setup. A contrary value requires the
manifest's hash-bound override input and current trusted evidence.

Inputs are not a secret store. A manifest should accept a path or environment
variable name instead of a credential value.

## Lifecycle

- `doctor` validates the interpreter, paths, manifest, scripts, and declared
  distributions without writing. When a run directory and every required
  input are supplied, it returns a replayable `start` command.
- `start` validates inputs, runs the declared preparation command in a staging
  directory, atomically publishes the run, and records the initial phase.
- `status` reads and verifies state without running a skill command.
- `next` runs exactly one phase-declared transition. A complete run is
  idempotent.
- `validate` runs the declared validator and advances only on success.
- `finalize` is phase-gated and marks the run complete only after every
  declared finalization and post-validation step succeeds.

The runtime treats `skill-protocol.json` as trusted installed-skill metadata,
but still rejects traversal, unknown placeholders, shell strings, undeclared
artifacts, unsafe run paths, and identity changes. Child processes receive
absolute paths, run with `shell=False`, and have stdout and stderr captured.

## Output and exit codes

The response schema is `response.schema.json`. JSON mode writes exactly one
compact JSON object and one newline to stdout and writes nothing to stderr.
Human mode writes a concise summary to stdout and failure diagnostics to
stderr.

Every JSON diagnostic follows `tools/diagnostics/diagnostic.schema.json`.
It names the owning skill, phase, artifact, record, field, and path; explains
why the failure matters; lists only repairs that preserve validation
strictness; includes local supporting evidence; and supplies a replayable
argv command when a safe retry exists. Repair the reported artifact or provide
the unavailable prerequisite. Never bypass, suppress, downgrade, or weaken a
validation gate.

- `0`: a usable response was produced successfully
- `2`: invalid invocation, manifest, input, state identity, or path
- `3`: prerequisites, phase gates, or validation block progress
- `4`: an existing skill command failed operationally
- `70`: an unexpected runtime defect

`next_command.argv` is an argv array, not a shell command. Consumers must
execute it directly with `next_command.cwd`.

Classifier request and repository content is always data. The runtime never
executes embedded commands, follows links, or treats issue text, comments,
generated files, or model output as authority.

Stateless `run` does not accept `--run-dir`, does not write protocol state, and
returns wrapped structured output in the optional `result` field.

## Manifest contract

The manifest schema is `manifest.schema.json`. Commands contain ordered steps.
Each step declares an argv array, optional repeated input expansions, optional
stdout artifact capture, diagnostic JSON handling, and whether failure is a
workflow block or operational error.

Allowed placeholders are `{python}`, `{skill_dir}`, `{repo_root}`, `{run_dir}`,
and `{input.<name>}`. Repeated inputs use the step's `repeat` entries and are
never interpolated into a shell.

Phase names are skill-defined except for the required terminal `complete`
phase. `conditional_reads` can add paths for selected declared input values
without exposing unrelated references in other runs.

Stateful manifests require `start`; stateless manifests require `run`.
Skill-defined transition commands are reached through `next`, and command
variants must resolve from declared choice inputs to exactly one branch.
`required_for` inputs may be supplied at later transitions and become
immutable when stored. External artifacts must resolve directly from declared
path inputs and be listed in the active phase's `allowed_writes`.

Protocol 1.x may add optional behavior but will not change required response
fields, their types, command meanings, or exit-code categories. Breaking
changes require a new major `protocol_version`.
